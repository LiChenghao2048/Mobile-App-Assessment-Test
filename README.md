Mobile App Assessment Test

Two classes compose the code: a customer class and a robot class. The customer class contains information about the customer, including the name and orders. It also keeps track of the severing status of each order. The robot class, on the other hand, manages the customer class. It engages with customers and records their demands, and serve orders to each customer. Once a customer has finished all his meal, the robot will remind him to check out at the front desk.
